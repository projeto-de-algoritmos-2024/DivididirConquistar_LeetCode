Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example 1:

- Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
- Output: [1,2,3,5]
- Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3),    while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

Example 2:

- Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
- Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
- Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
- -5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104
